## üö® URGENT: Exposed Credentials

**If you cloned this repository before the security fix on October 31, 2025**, the Prisma Accelerate API key was exposed in the `wrangler.jsonc` file. This key has been committed to version control and should be considered compromised.

### Immediate Actions Required

#### 1. Rotate Your Prisma Accelerate API Key

1. **Go to Prisma Data Platform Console**
   - Visit: https://console.prisma.io/
   - Log in to your account

2. **Navigate to Your Project**
   - Select your Medium Clone project
   - Go to the "Accelerate" section

3. **Regenerate API Key**
   - Find the "API Keys" section
   - Click "Rotate Key" or "Generate New Key"
   - Copy the new connection string
   - **IMPORTANT**: The old key will stop working immediately

4. **Update Your Configuration**
   - Update your `.dev.vars` file with the new connection string
   - Update Cloudflare Workers secrets (if deployed):
     ```bash
     cd backend
     npx wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
     # Paste your new connection string when prompted
     ```

5. **Redeploy Your Application**
   ```bash
   npx wrangler deploy
   ```

#### 2. Generate a New JWT Secret

1. **Generate a secure random string:**
   ```bash
   # On Linux/Mac:
   openssl rand -base64 32
   
   # On Windows (PowerShell):
   $bytes = New-Object byte[] 32
   [Security.Cryptography.RandomNumberGenerator]::Create().GetBytes($bytes)
   [Convert]::ToBase64String($bytes)
   ```

2. **Update your `.dev.vars` file** with the new JWT secret

3. **Update Cloudflare Workers secrets** (if deployed):
   ```bash
   npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET
   # Paste your new secret when prompted
   ```

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Changing the JWT secret will invalidate all existing user sessions.

## Security Best Practices

### Never Commit Sensitive Data

The following files should **NEVER** be committed to version control:
- `.env` - Local environment variables
- `.dev.vars` - Cloudflare Workers local development variables
- Any file containing API keys, passwords, or secrets

Always use `.example` files to document required environment variables without exposing actual values.

### Environment Variables

- Use strong, randomly generated secrets for production
- Rotate credentials regularly
- Use different credentials for development, staging, and production
- Store production secrets in Cloudflare Workers dashboard, not in code

### Password Security

‚ö†Ô∏è **Current Issue**: Passwords are stored in plain text in the database. This will be fixed in an upcoming security update.

**Upcoming Fix**: Implement bcrypt password hashing before storing passwords.
